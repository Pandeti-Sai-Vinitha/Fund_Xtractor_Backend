1,BSE Eligibility Criteria,Post Issue Paid up Capital - Not more than Rs. 25 crores,"Under the head ' Capital Structure' If there is a blob in capital structure, promt for manual check ",SECTION_IV INTRODUCTION,CAPITAL STRUCTURE,Whether the aggregate nominal value under paid up equity capital after the offer is not more than Rs. 25 crores.,,LG ELECTRONICS INDIA LIMITED,2025-11-05T16:56:10.402675+05:30,John,dhrp_lg.pdf,"Based on the provided excerpts, it is **unclear** whether the company meets the listing criteria that the aggregate nominal value under paid-up equity capital after the offer is not more than Rs. 25 crores.

While the document provides information on the authorized, issued, subscribed, and paid-up share capital before the offer, as well as details of the present offer, the ""ISSUED, SUBSCRIBED AND PAID-UP SHARE CAPITAL AFTER THE OFFER"" is represented by ""[●]"" (Chunk 1). This placeholder indicates that the final value is yet to be determined and updated upon finalization of the Offer Price and Basis of Allotment.

Without knowing the final paid-up equity capital after the offer, it is impossible to definitively say whether it will be more than Rs. 25 crores."
2,BSE Eligibility Criteria,Networth - Atleast Rs. 1 crore for 2 preceding full financial years.,Under the head Summary of Offer Document or Summary of Draft Prospectus,SECTION_II Summary of Offer Document or Summary of Draft Prospectus,Summary of Financial Information or Summary of Restated Financial Information ,"(1) Compare the requirement of net-worth in the Summary of Financial information with the minimum eligibility criteria.

(2) Ignore Standalone figures if both Consolidated and Standalone financials provided.",This can Also be Cross Verified From the figures disclosed in the Chapter Other Regulatory and Statutory Disclosures - 'Criteria for eligibility on SME platform of BSE Limited'.,LG ELECTRONICS INDIA LIMITED,2025-11-05T16:56:10.402675+05:30,John,dhrp_lg.pdf,"Based on the provided excerpts, I can evaluate whether the company meets the net worth eligibility criteria for listing. The requirement is a net worth of at least Rs. 1 crore for the two preceding full financial years.

The excerpts define ""Net Worth"" as the aggregate value of paid-up share capital and other equity created out of the profits, securities premium account and debit or credit balance of profit and loss account, after deducting the aggregate value of the accumulated losses, deferred expenditure and miscellaneous expenditure not written off, derived from the Restated Financial Information, but does not include reserves created out of revaluation of assets, write-back of depreciation and amalgamation.

To determine whether the company meets this criteria, I need to calculate the Net Worth for the two preceding financial years, which are Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2022 based on the information provided. The excerpt provides the Equity attributable to equity holders of the parent (which is equivalent to net worth based on definition provided) for the periods.

The Equity attributable to equity holders of the parent is:
*   Fiscal 2023: ₹ 43,198.20 million
*   Fiscal 2022: ₹ 54,643.20 million

Converting these values to crores:
*   Fiscal 2023: ₹ 4,319.82 crores
*   Fiscal 2022: ₹ 5,464.32 crores

Since both these values are greater than Rs. 1 crore, the company meets the net worth eligibility criteria for the two preceding financial years."
3,BSE Eligibility Criteria,Net Tangible Asset - Rs 3 crores in last preceding (full) financial year.,Under the head Other Regulatory and Statutory Disclosures - 'Criteria for eligibility on SME platform of BSE Limited'.,SECTION_VIII - Other Regulatory and Statutiry Disclosures,Criteria eligibility on SME platform of BSE Limited,Whether the amount for Net Tangible Asset disclosed in last preceding full financial year is Rs. 3 crores or more ,This can Also be Cross Verified From the figures disclosed in the Chapter Other Regulatory and Statutory Disclosures - 'Criteria for eligibility on SME platform of BSE Limited'.,LG ELECTRONICS INDIA LIMITED,2025-11-05T16:56:10.402675+05:30,John,dhrp_lg.pdf,"The company meets the listing eligibility criteria regarding Net Tangible Assets.

**Evidence:**

The document states that ""Restated Net tangible assets"" for the financial year ended March 31, 2024 was ₹36,348.26 million (Chunk 3).
Since ₹36,348.26 million is equal to ₹3634.826 crores, which is more than Rs. 3 crores, the company meets the criterion for Net Tangible Assets."
4,BSE Eligibility Criteria,"Track Record -The track record of applicant company seeking listing should be atleast 3 years. Where the applicant company has taken over a proprietorship concern/ firm/ LLP, then the track record together with such proprietorship concern/ registered firm/ LLP should be atleast 3 years. registered partnership Provided, the applicant company seeking listing should have a track record of operations for atleast one full financial year and audited financial results for one full financial  year.Or Where the applicant company does not have a track record of 3 years, then the Project for which IPO is being proposed should be appraised and funded by NABARD, SIDBI, Banks (other than co-operative banks), Financial Institutions.Provided, the applicant company seeking listing should have a track record of operations for atleast one full financial year and audited financial results for one full financial year.",Cover page and Chapter - History and certain corporate matters ,Section VI - History and certain corporate matters,Brief history of our Company,"For 3 years track record:

**Determination:** The company appears to meet the 3-year track record requirement.

**Evidence:**

*   The ""Certificate of incorporation"" excerpt states that the company was originally incorporated on **January 20, 1997**.
*   Though there was a change in name and status (from deemed public to private, and then to public), the company's existence dates back to 1997.
*   The company has been in existence since January 20, 1997, as stated in ""History and certain Corporate Matters"".

**Conclusion:**
The company's incorporation date is January 20, 1997, which is well over three years prior to the date of the draft offer document (December 6, 2024, as seen from resolutions of the board and IPO committee). Therefore, the company meets the minimum 3-year track record requirement."
5,BSE Eligibility Criteria,"Earnings before Interest, Depreciation and tax -The company/ proprietorship concern/ registered firm/ LLP should have operating profit (earnings before interest, depreciation and tax) from operations for 2 out of 3 latest financial years preceding the application date.Provided the company should have operating profit (earnings before interest, depreciation and tax) from operations for one full financial year preceding the application date.For companies seeking listing where the project has been appraised and funded by NABARD, SIDBI, Banks (other than co-operative banks), Financial Institutions, it shall have positive operating profit (earnings before interest, depreciation and tax) from operations in one full preceding financial year.",Under the head Other Regulatory and Statutory Disclosures - 'Criteria for eligibility on SME platform of BSE Limited'.,SECTION_VIII - Other Regulatory and Statutory Disclosures,Criteria eligibility on SME platform of BSE Limited,"Whether the amount for Earnings before interest, Depreciation and tax disclosed in last preceding full financial year is Rs. 3 crores or more ",This can Also be Cross Verified From the figures disclosed in the Chapter Other Regulatory and Statutory Disclosures - 'Criteria for eligibility on SME platform of BSE Limited'.,LG ELECTRONICS INDIA LIMITED,2025-11-05T16:56:10.402675+05:30,John,dhrp_lg.pdf,"Based on the provided excerpts, it is possible to determine whether the company meets the listing criteria related to Earnings Before Interest, Depreciation, and Tax (EBITDA).

The eligibility criteria state that the company should have an operating profit (EBITDA) for at least one full financial year preceding the application date.

According to financial data from the restated consolidated statement of profit and loss, the EBITDA figures (referred to as ""Operating profit, as restated"" in one excerpt) for the three most recent fiscal years are:

*   Fiscal 2024: ₹18,605.04 million
*   Fiscal 2023: ₹15,947.22 million
*   Fiscal 2022: ₹14,066.53 million

Since the EBITDA for each of the three preceding fiscal years (2024, 2023, and 2022) is significantly above Rs. 3 crores (Rs. 30 million), the company meets this specific eligibility criterion."
6,BSE Eligibility Criteria,Leverage Ratio - Leverage ratio of not more than 3:1. Relaxation may be granted to finance companies.,Under the head Other Regulatory and Statutory Disclosures - 'Criteria for eligibility on SME platform of BSE Limited'.,SECTION_VIII - Other Regulatory and Statutory Disclosures,Criteria eligibility on SME platform of BSE Limited,Whether the ratio for Leverage Ratio is not more than 3:1,,LG ELECTRONICS INDIA LIMITED,2025-11-05T16:56:10.402675+05:30,John,dhrp_lg.pdf,"Based on the provided excerpts, it's possible to determine whether the company meets the leverage ratio criterion.

The ""CAPITALISATION STATEMENT"" table provides information about the company’s ""Total Borrowings/Total equity"" as of June 30, 2024. The ratio is 0.00%.

The debt-to-equity ratio is explicitly listed in the 'Ratios' section for previous years(March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022), but it does not exceed 3:1.

The company's leverage ratio, represented by ""Total Borrowings/Total equity,"" is 0.00% as of June 30, 2024. This is significantly below the threshold of 3:1. Therefore, based on this information, the company meets the listing eligibility criteria for the leverage ratio."
7,BSE Eligibility Criteria,Disciplinary action -No regulatory action of suspension of trading against the promoter(s) or companies promoted by the promoters by any stock Exchange having nationwide trading terminals.The Promoter(s) or directors shall not be promoter(s) or directors (other than independent directors) of compulsory delisted companies by the Exchange and the applicability of consequences of compulsory delisting is attracted or companies that are suspended from trading on account of non-compliance.Director should not be disqualified/ debarred by any of the Regulatory Authority.,Under the head Other Regulatory and Statutory Disclosures - 'Criteria for eligibility on SME platform of BSE Limited'.,SECTION_VIII - Other Regulatory and Statutory Disclosures,Criteria eligibility on SME platform of BSE Limited,"There are no regulatory action of suspension of trading against the promoter(s) or companies promoted by the promoters by any stock Exchange having nationwide trading terminals. 

The Promoter(s) or directors shall not be promoter(s) or director(s) (other than independent directors) of compulsory delisted companies by the Exchange and the applicability of consequences of compulsory delisting is attracted or companies that are suspended from trading on account of non-compliance.

Director should not be disqualified/ debarred by any of the Regulatory Authority.",This data is available on the watchout investor/ Cibil site also the list of debarred entities are available on the SEBI /BSE/ NSE websites also,LG ELECTRONICS INDIA LIMITED,2025-11-05T16:56:10.402675+05:30,John,dhrp_lg.pdf,"Based on the provided excerpts, I cannot definitively determine whether the company meets all the listing criteria related to disciplinary action against the promoter(s), companies promoted by the promoters, and directors. Here's why:

**Support for Meeting Criteria:**

*   The document states, ""Our Company, Promoter or Directors have neither been declared as Wilful Defaulters or Fraudulent Borrowers by any bank or financial institution or consortium thereof in accordance with the guidelines on wilful defaulters and fraudulent borrowers issued by the RBI.""
*   It also says, ""Our Company or our Promoter, members of the Promoter Group or Directors are not declared as ‘Fraudulent Borrowers’ by the lending banks or financial institution or consortium, in terms of RBI master circular dated July 1, 2016 and the SEBI ICDR Regulations.""
*   Regarding directors associated with the securities market, the document mentions that ""Except for Santosh Kumar Mohanty who is associated with securities market as disclosed below, none of our Directors are, in any manner, associated with the securities market and there is no outstanding action initiated by the SEBI against the Directors of our Company in the past five years preceding the date of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus."" It then details Santosh Kumar Mohanty's association with Computer Age Management Services Limited, a SEBI-registered entity, and clarifies that there are no enquiry or investigation conducted by SEBI related to adjudication proceedings, suspension/cancellation/prohibitory orders.

**Unclear or Unmet Criteria:**

*   The excerpts do not explicitly state that there has been no regulatory action of suspension of trading against the promoter(s) or companies promoted by the promoters by any stock Exchange having nationwide trading terminals.
*   The excerpts do not explicitly state that The Promoter(s) or directors shall not be promoter(s) or directors (other than independent directors) of compulsory delisted companies by the Exchange and the applicability of consequences of compulsory delisting is attracted or companies that are suspended from trading on account of non-compliance.
*   The excerpts do not explicitly state that Director should not be disqualified/ debarred by any of the Regulatory Authority.

**Conclusion:**

While some information suggests compliance (no declaration as willful defaulters/fraudulent borrowers, no SEBI action against directors), the absence of explicit statements addressing suspension of trading, compulsory delisting, and director disqualification/debarment prevents a definitive positive determination. To fully assess eligibility, explicit confirmation regarding these specific points is needed. This information could potentially be verified through external sources like the watchout investor site, CIBIL, SEBI, BSE, and NSE websites as noted in the ""Remarks."""

Supporting Evidence:

*   The document states, ""Our Company, Promoter or Directors have neither been declared as Wilful Defaulters or Fraudulent Borrowers by any bank or financial institution or consortium thereof in accordance with the guidelines on wilful defaulters and fraudulent borrowers issued by the RBI.""

*   The document further states, ""Our Company or our Promoter, members of the Promoter Group or Directors are not declared as ‘Fraudulent Borrowers’ by the lending banks or financial institution or consortium, in terms of RBI master circular dated July 1, 2016 and the SEBI ICDR Regulations.""

*   Regarding directors, the document states ""there is no outstanding action initiated by the SEBI against the Directors of our Company in the past five years preceding the date of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus.""

However, the document doesn't *explicitly* state that *no* promoter or director is a promoter or director of any *other* company debarred from accessing the capital market by the Board (SEBI). While the provided excerpts state they aren't *personally* declared defaulters or facing SEBI action, it doesn't negate the possibility of their association with a *different* debarred company.

Therefore, while the available information suggests compliance, a definitive conclusion requires a statement specifically addressing the listing criteria."
10,228 (c) of SEBI ICDR,if the issuer or any of its promoters or directors is a  wilful defaulter or a fraudulent borrower.,Under the head legal  and other information  -other regulatory and statutory disclosure.,SECTION_VIII  -Other Regulatory and Statutory Disclosures,Eligbility for the issue,The issuer or any of its promoters or directors is a wilful defaulter or a fradulent borrower,This data is available on the watchout investor site/ CIBIL also the list of debarred entities are available on the SEBI /BSE/ NSE websites also ,LG ELECTRONICS INDIA LIMITED,2025-11-05T16:56:10.402675+05:30,John,dhrp_lg.pdf,"Based on the provided excerpts, the company appears to meet the listing criteria related to not being a wilful defaulter or fraudulent borrower.

Additionally, a statement in the financial information section notes, ""The Company has not been declared a wilful defaulter by any bank or financial institution or government or any government authority."""
