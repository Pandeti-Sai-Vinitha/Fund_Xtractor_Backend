1,BSE Eligibility Criteria,Post Issue Paid up Capital - Not more than Rs. 25 crores,"Under the head ' Capital Structure' If there is a blob in capital structure, promt for manual check ",SECTION_IV INTRODUCTION,CAPITAL STRUCTURE,Whether the aggregate nominal value under paid up equity capital after the offer is not more than Rs. 25 crores.,,LEAP INDIA LIMITED,2025-11-05T18:14:55.094482+05:30,John,sample_dhrp.pdf,"Based on the provided excerpts, it is unclear whether the company meets the listing criteria that the aggregate nominal value of paid-up equity capital after the offer is not more than Rs. 25 crores.

The excerpts contain the following information:

*   **Authorized Share Capital:** Includes equity shares with a face value of ₹1 each, totaling 6,351,448,589.

*   **Issued, Subscribed, and Paid-Up Share Capital (Before the Offer):** 410,347,780 equity shares of face value of ₹1 each.

*   **Present Offer:** Includes a fresh issue of up to \[●] equity shares of face value of ₹1 each aggregating up to ₹ 4,000.00 million.

*   **Issued, Subscribed, and Paid-Up Share Capital After the Offer:** \[●] equity shares of face value of ₹1 each.

*   **Equity Share capital (D):** 30.18 million

The key piece of information missing is the exact number of equity shares outstanding *after* the offer (""\[●] equity shares of face value of ₹1 each""). Without this number, it's impossible to calculate the aggregate nominal value of the paid-up equity capital after the offer and determine if it is less than Rs. 25 crores.

Therefore, based on the available information, it's impossible to definitively say whether the company meets this listing criterion. Manual check required to fill in the [●] with the exact number."
2,BSE Eligibility Criteria,Networth - Atleast Rs. 1 crore for 2 preceding full financial years.,Under the head Summary of Offer Document or Summary of Draft Prospectus,SECTION_II Summary of Offer Document or Summary of Draft Prospectus,Summary of Financial Information or Summary of Restated Financial Information ,"(1) Compare the requirement of net-worth in the Summary of Financial information with the minimum eligibility criteria.

The document presents the ""Reconciliation for Net Worth"" on a consolidated basis for the fiscal years 2023, 2024, and 2025. The net worth figures are:

*   **Fiscal 2023:** ₹5,694.06 million
*   **Fiscal 2024:** ₹7,141.78 million
*   **Fiscal 2025:** ₹9,173.48 million

Since ₹5,694.06 million and ₹7,141.78 million are both significantly greater than the required ₹10 million (Rs. 1 crore), the company satisfies the requirement of having a net worth of at least Rs. 1 crore for the two preceding full financial years."
3,BSE Eligibility Criteria,Net Tangible Asset - Rs 3 crores in last preceding (full) financial year.,Under the head Other Regulatory and Statutory Disclosures - 'Criteria for eligibility on SME platform of BSE Limited'.,SECTION_VIII - Other Regulatory and Statutiry Disclosures,Criteria eligibility on SME platform of BSE Limited,Whether the amount for Net Tangible Asset disclosed in last preceding full financial year is Rs. 3 crores or more ,This can Also be Cross Verified From the figures disclosed in the Chapter Other Regulatory and Statutory Disclosures - 'Criteria for eligibility on SME platform of BSE Limited'.,LEAP INDIA LIMITED,2025-11-05T18:14:55.094482+05:30,John,sample_dhrp.pdf,"The company meets the listing eligibility criteria of having Net Tangible Assets of Rs. 3 crores or more in the last preceding full financial year.

*   March 31, 2024: Net Tangible Assets of 6,609.26
*   March 31, 2023: Net Tangible Assets of 5,154.20

Since ₹1 crore equals ₹10 million, the requirement is ₹30 million. Both fiscal years 2024 and 2023 show Net Tangible Assets exceeding ₹30 million. Therefore, the company satisfies the Net Tangible Asset criterion. This is confirmed in the section ""OTHER REGULATORY AND STATUTORY DISCLOSURES"", which lists Net Tangible Assets of ₹6,609.26 million and ₹5,154.20 million for the years ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, respectively."

The excerpts provide the following information regarding profit before tax, depreciation, amortisation and impairment expenses, and finance costs:

*   **Fiscal 2025:** Profit before tax was ₹520.57 million, depreciation, amortisation and impairment expenses were ₹1,537.29 million, and finance cost was ₹680.11 million.
*   **Fiscal 2024:** Profit before tax was ₹467.07 million, depreciation, amortisation and impairment expenses were ₹1,126.09 million, and finance cost was ₹506.02 million.
*   **Fiscal 2023:** Profit before tax was ₹98.22 million, depreciation, amortisation and impairment expenses were ₹740.28 million, and finance cost was ₹424.42 million.

EBITDA can be calculated by adding Profit Before Tax + Depreciation, Amortisation and Impairment Expenses + Finance Cost.

*   **Fiscal 2025 EBITDA:** ₹520.57 + ₹1,537.29 + ₹680.11 = ₹2,737.97 million
*   **Fiscal 2024 EBITDA:** ₹467.07 + ₹1,126.09 + ₹506.02 = ₹2,099.18 million
*   **Fiscal 2023 EBITDA:** ₹98.22 + ₹740.28 + ₹424.42 = ₹1,262.92 million

The question specifies that we need to consider the amount for the last preceding full financial year, which is Fiscal 2025. The calculated EBITDA for Fiscal 2025 is ₹2,737.97 million. Converting this to crores: ₹2,737.97 million / 10 = ₹273.80 crores (approximately).

The eligibility criteria require EBITDA to be Rs. 3 crores or more in the last preceding full financial year. Since ₹273.80 crores is greater than Rs. 3 crores, the company meets the listing eligibility criteria for EBITDA.

Additionally, excerpts also provide Operating Profit figures for the preceding financial years calculated as profit before finance costs, other income and tax expense:

*   **Fiscal 2025 Operating Profit:** ₹1,015.09 million
*   **Fiscal 2024 Operating Profit:** ₹903.36 million
*   **Fiscal 2023 Operating Profit:** ₹474.66 million

The excerpts provide the following information, which is relevant to calculating the leverage ratio for the company as of March 31, 2025:

*   **Total Borrowings:** ₹ 8,016.58 million (Current borrowings + Non-current borrowings)
*   **Total Equity:** ₹ 9,173.48 million

The leverage ratio is Debt / Equity, which, in this case, equals 8,016.58 / 9,173.48 = 0.87

The listing criteria state that the leverage ratio should not be more than 3:1.

Since the calculated leverage ratio of 0.87 is less than 3, the company meets this listing criterion."
