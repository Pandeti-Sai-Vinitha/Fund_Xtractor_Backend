Key areas to further investigate include strategies for maintaining an active trading market for Fund Shares, and the mechanisms in place to ensure adequate authorized participant engagement to minimize the risk of trading at a discount. Also, the document does not provide detail on the valuation processes used by the fund, and whether these adequately account for illiquidity or other risks within their holdings. Further analysis of the fund's specific investment strategies and holdings would be necessary for a comprehensive risk assessment."
