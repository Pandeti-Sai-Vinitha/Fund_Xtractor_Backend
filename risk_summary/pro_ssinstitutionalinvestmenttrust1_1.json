While some mitigation strategies are mentioned (diversification, collateralization), more detail is needed regarding specific risk management policies, diversification targets, counterparty creditworthiness assessments, and valuation methodologies. The tracking error risk associated with index funds should be closely monitored. It would benefit the DHRP to include more comprehensive risk mitigation strategies."
