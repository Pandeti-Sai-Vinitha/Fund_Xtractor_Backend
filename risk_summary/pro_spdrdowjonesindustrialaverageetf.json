This is a significant strategic risk.\n*   The risk summary highlights the need for investors to be aware of the potential impact of trading costs, especially for those considering frequent small investments.\n*   The Distributor plays a vital role in unit creation and redemption, and any operational disruptions could affect Authorized Participants and the overall efficiency of the fund.\n* The disclaimer from S&P regarding the DJIA is extensive. Although the Trust does not have control over the index, it must factor in reputational risk if the DJIA has errors."
